# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect {ONS} device running {Ubuntu} with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-python]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   {enter your device name here} device.
-   {{Please specify if any other software(s) or hardware(s) are required.}}

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   {{Make sure the Internet is on the machine, make sure the OPCUA function is turned on, and then execute the azure-iot connection. Azure..}}

<a name="Build"></a>
# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for Python by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:
{{***Keep the command set based on your OS and remove the rest.***}}

     **Debian or Ubuntu**

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev build-essential cmake git python2.7-dev libboost-python-dev

    **Fedora**

        sudo dnf check-update -y

        sudo dnf install libcurl-devel openssl-devel gcc-c++ make cmake git python2.7-dev libboost-python-dev

    **Any Other Linux OS**

        Use equivalent commands on the target OS

    {{***If any other software is required, please specify here the command(s) for installing same.***}}

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git

-   Run following commands to build the SDK:

        cd python/build_all/linux
	    sudo ./build.sh    

-   After a successful build, the `iothub_client.so` Python extension module is copied to the **python/device/samples** folder.

- Navigate to samples folder by executing following command:

        cd azure-iot-sdk-python/device/samples/

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:
    {{***Keep the file based on your protocol(s) and remove the rest.***}}

    **For AMQP protocol:**

        nano iothub_client_sample_amqp.py

    **For HTTP protocol:**

        nano iothub_client_sample_http.py

    **For MQTT protocol:**

        nano iothub_client_sample_mqtt.py

-   Find the following place holder for device connection string:

        connectionString = "[device connection string]"

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample application using the following command:
{{***Keep the command set based on your protocol(s) and remove the rest.***}}

    **For AMQP protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample_amqp.py

    **For HTTP protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample_http.py

    **For MQTT protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample_mqtt.py

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
