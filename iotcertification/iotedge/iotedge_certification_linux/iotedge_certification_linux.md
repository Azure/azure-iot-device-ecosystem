# Introduction

**About this document**

This document provides step-by-step guidance to IoT hardware publishers on how to certify an IoT Edge enabled hardware with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Edge
-   Registering your IoT Edge device
-   Manual Test for Azure IoT Edge on device
-   Packaging and sharing the files and device

**Prepare:**

Before executing any of the steps below, read through each steps to ensure end to end understanding.

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   Computer with GitHub installed and access to the [azure-iot-sdk](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) GitHub public repository.
-   SSH client, such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), so you can access the command line.
-   Required hardware to certify.

Note: If you haven't contacted Microsoft about being an Azure Certified for IoT partner, please submit this [form](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/) first to request it and then follow these instructions.

# Step 1: Sign Up To Azure IoT Hub

[Sign up](https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p) to the Azure IoT Hub service and follow the instructions mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux). As part of the sign up process, you will receive the connection string.

-   **IoT Hub Connection String**: An example of IoT hub Connection String is as below:

         HostName=[YourIoTHubName];SharedAccessKeyName=[YourAccessKeyName];SharedAccessKey=[YourAccessKey]

<a name="Step-2-Register"></a>
# Step 2: Register Device

In this section, you will register your Edge device using DeviceExplorer. The DeviceExplorer is a Windows application that interfaces with Azure IoT Hub and can perform the following operations:

-   Device management
    -   Create new devices
    -   List existing devices and expose device properties stored on Device Hub
    -   Provides ability to update device keys
    -   Provides ability to delete a device
-   Monitoring events from your device
-   Sending messages to your device

To run DeviceExplorer tool, use following configuration string as described in
[Step1](#Step-1-Configure):

-   IoT Hub Connection String

**Steps:**
1.  Click [here](<https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md>) to download and install DeviceExplorer.

2.  Add connection information under the Configuration tab and click the **Update** button.

3.  Create and register the device with your IoT Hub using instructions as below.

    a. Click the **Management** tab.

    b. Your registered devices will be displayed in the list. In case your device is not there in the list, click **Refresh** button. If this is your first time, then you shouldn't retrieve anything.

    c. Click **Create** button to create a device ID and key.

    d. Once created successfully, device will be listed in DeviceExplorer.

    e. Right click the device and from context menu select "**Copy connection
    string for selected device**".

    f. Save this information in Notepad. You will need this information in
    later steps.

***Not running Windows on your PC?*** - Please follow the instructions [here](<https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md>) to provision your device and get its credentials.

# Step 3: Manual Test for Azure IoT Edge on device

This section walks you through the test to be performed on the Edge devices running the Linux operating system such  that it can qualify for Azure IoT Edge certification 

<a name="Step-3-1-IoTEdgeRunTime"></a>
## 3.1 Edge RuntimeEnabled (Mandatory)
*Total number of Level : 1*

**Description:** A device which includes the Azure IoT Edge runtime and dependencies.Download the Azure IoT Edge Runtime from the [link](https://aka.ms/iotedgeruntime)

**Details of the requirement:**

The following components come pre-installed or at the point of distribution on the device to customer(s):

-   Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
-   Daemon configuration file
-   Moby container management system
-   A version of `hsmlib` 

The IoT Edge runtime becomes functional at boot via DPS integration or by the user entering device credentials into the **config** file.

**Test steps:**

-   Company must send the edge device to Microsoft for additional validation. We will send detail instructions and information we need when the company submit the device for Azure IoT edge certification.
-   Company needs to ensure sure that the edge device comes both Azure IoT Edge Security daemon and Moby container management system pre-installed
    -   Microsoft will check that the edge device comes with Azure IoT Edge Security Daemon
    -   Microsoft will check that the edge device comes with Moby container management system
-   Company needs to provide Microsoft the instruction on how to connect to IoT Hub via email
    -   Config file to connect
    -   How the device is provisioned
    -   Other important information 
-   Please allow some time to process and complete the certification process. Microsoft will ship back the edge device upon approval.

## 3.2 Device Management (Mandatory)
*Total number of Level : 1* 

**Pre-requisites:** Device Connectivity.

**Description:** A device that can perform basic device management operations triggered by messages from IoT Hub.

**Details of the requirement:**

The device must have components that are capable of the following:

1.  Supports the use of device twins to trigger a firmware or operating system update and to report status including error messages or details
2.  Supports the use of direct methods to trigger a reboot and uses device twin to report last boot time.

The component may come pre-installed or at the point of distribution to the customer.The following Manual test applies to Linux distributions that support updates either through package managers like dpkg or apt, or by updating as an atomic image.

**Manual test 1:** 

1.  If the component comes at the point of distribution of the device, put the step-by-step instructions for installing the components into a readme.md file and include with your submission
2.  Connect the device to Azure IoT Hub
3.  Use Windows 10 Problem Steps Recorder (or equivalent) to capture the following steps

    a. Using the Azure Portal, set the device twin desired properties that will initiate the device to install new updates.

    **Note:** You may perform this step pro-grammatically instead of using the portal, if preferred.

    b. Allow the device to update and report status through the device twin reported properties.

    c. Capture entire device twin JSON content for each state change.
4.  Include the .zip file saved from the Problem Steps Recorder as part of your submission.

**Manual test 2:**

1.  If the component comes at the point of distribution of the device, put the step-by-step instructions for installing the components into a readme.md file and include with your submission
2.  Connect the device to Azure IoT Hub
3.  Use Windows 10 Problem Steps Recorder (or equivalent) to capture the following steps

    a. Using the Azure Portal, send a direct method to the device. Capture the direct method name, payload, and result into a .txt file.

    **Note:** You may perform this step pro-grammatically instead of using the portal, if preferred.

    b.  Capture the entire device twin JSON content. It should include a reported property that shows the last reboot time.
4.  Include the .zip file saved from the Problem Steps Recorder as part of your submission.
