# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect AR8300 Model 300L device running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSB 2016 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   AR8300 Model 300L device.

# Step 3: Build SDK and Run the sample

-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015. Open the **azure\_iot\_sdks.sln** solution in the **cmake** folder in your home directory.

-   In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, navigate to **simplesample\_amqp** project, open the **simplesample\_amqp.c** file.

-   Locate the following code in the file:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **simplesample\_amqp** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
