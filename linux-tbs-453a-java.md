# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect TBS-453A device running docker-library/java:openjdk-8u91-jdk with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   TBS-453A device.
-   Connect TBS-453A and your computer to internet

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Install the latest Container Station on your TBS-453A by following the instructions in the ["How to use Container Station?"](https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/tutorial/article/how-to-use-container-station).

-   Create "java:openjdk-8u91-jdk" container in Container Station and start it.

-   Into Terminal two options :
    -   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device use SSH. Then key in command : 
        
            docker exec -ti <your container name> bash

    -   Or click "Terminal" button on container station website and key in "bash" then click ok to enter terminall

-   Install Text editor "nano" : 

        apt update
        apt install nano

## 3.1 Install Azure IoT Device SDK and prerequisites on device

-   Open NAS webpage and open Container Station.

-   Change page to your container.

-   Click "Terminal" button and key in "bash" in your java container to enter terminal.

-   Install the prerequisite packages by issuing the following commands from the command line on the device.

<a name="Step_3_1_1"/></a>
### 3.1.1  Install Maven and set up environment variables

1.  In a shell, type the following commands:

        apt update 
        apt install maven

2.  Update the PATH environment variable to include the full path to the bin folder containing maven. To ensure the correct path of maven, run below command:     
       
        which mvn
         
3.  Ensure that the directory shown by the `which mvn` command matches one of the directories shown in your $PATH variable. You can confirm this by running following command.
 
        echo $PATH

4.  If maven path is missing in PATH environment variable, run following command to set the same.     

        export PATH=[PathToMvn]/bin:$PATH

    ***Note***: *Here [PathToMvn] is output of `which mvn`. For example if `which mvn` output is /usr/bin/mvn, export command will be* **export PATH=/usr/bin/mvn/bin:$PATH**
   
5.  You can verify that the environment variables necessary to run Maven 3 have been set correctly by running `mvn --version`.

### 3.1.2 Build the Azure IoT Device SDK for Java

1.  Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in Terminal:

        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java.git

2.  Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory **azure-iot-sdk-java**.

3.  Run the following commands on device in sequence to build Azure IoT SDK.

        cd azure-iot-sdk-java/device
        mvn install | tee JavaSDK_Build_Logs.txt

4.  Above command will generate the compiled JAR files with all dependencies. This bundle can be found at:

        azure-iot-sdk-java/device/iothub-java-client/target/iothub-java-client-{version}-with-deps.jar

## 3.2 Run and Validate the Samples

<a name="Step_3_2_1"/></a>
### 3.2.1 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for send event sample.

        cd azure-iot-sdk-java/device/iot-device-samples/send-event/target

-   Run the sample by issuing following command.

    **If using AMQPS protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "amqps"
    
    **If using HTTPS protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "https"

    **If using MQTT protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "mqtt"

    **If using Web Sockets with AMQP protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "amqps_ws"

    **If using Web Sockets with MQTT protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "mqtt_ws"


    Replace the following in above command:
    
    -   `{version}`: Version of binaries you have build
    -   `{connection string}`: Your device connection string
    -   `{number of requests to send}`: Number of messages you want to send to IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.2.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   Navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for the receive message sample.

        cd azure-iot-sdk-java/device/iot-device-samples/handle-messages/target
     
-   Run the sample by issuing following command.

    **If using AMQPS protocol:**
   
        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "amqps"
    
    **If using HTTPS protocol:**
   
        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "https"

    **If using MQTT protocol:**
   
        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "mqtt"

    **If using Web Sockets with AMQP protocol:**

        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "amqps_ws"

    **If using Web Sockets with MQTT protocol:**

        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "mqtt_ws"



    Replace the following in above command:
    
    -   `{version}`: Version of binaries you have build
    -   `{connection string}`: Your device connection string
    -   `{number of requests to send}`: Number of messages you want to send to IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
