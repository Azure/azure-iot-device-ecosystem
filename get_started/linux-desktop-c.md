# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to build and run the **simplesample_amqp** application on a desktop Linux platform. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Step-1-Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]

# Step 2: Build and Run the sample

1.   Open the file **c/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp.c** in a text editor.

2.   Locate the following code in the file:
      ```
      static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
      ```
3.   Replace "[device connection string]" with the device connection string you noted [earlier](#Step-1-Prerequisites). Save the changes.

5.   Save your changes and build the samples. To build your sample you can run the the build.sh script in the **c/build_all/linux** directory.

6.   Run the **~/azure-iot-sdk-c/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp** sample application.

7.   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **simplesample_amqp** application and how to send cloud-to-device messages to the **simplesample_amqp** application.

# TLS handshake
If you are **not** able to connect because certification validation issue, you can use following steps for debugging.

Connection to Azure IoT Hub is secured through [TLS]. As part of [TLS] handshake, client has to validate server side **Root CA** [Step 3] of TLS handshake.

Quick way to test to make sure underlying platform has Root CA as **trusted**, you can using following [curl] command with [verbose] -v option

`curl -v -H "Authorization:SharedAccessSignature sr={My SAS}” https://{MyTestHub}.azure-devices.net/devices/{My Device}/messages/events?api-version=2016-11-14 -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{ \"My Key\": \"My Value\" }"`

Replace {My SAS} with your corresponding device SAS. {MyTestHub} with your Azure IoT Hub name. {My Device} with your device ID. Remove {} parenthesis while filling it with your strings.

> Tip: curl [verbose] **-v** option will give you more debugging information around TLS handshake process.

Above curl command will use device-to-cloud (D2C) [REST API] call. If you are able to successfully send the message, you should see HTTP/1.1 204 response status code. Root CA copy (**ms.der**) is located at c\certs for reference.
