# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect  [LattePanda](http://www.lattepanda.com)  device running Windows10 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]

    **Note:** LattePanda runs a full edition of Windows 10, so you are able to install the development environment on your LattePanda and run this example directly. You can also develop on another computer and then copy the released .exe file to your Lattepanda if you prefer. In this tutorial, we developed directly on a LattePanda.

-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]

-   [LattePanda](http://www.lattepanda.com)  device.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub_csharp_client.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, open the ***Program.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

          private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";

-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client AMQP Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
