# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect an InsightCM Server device running Windows Server 2012R2 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   InsightCM Server device.
-   InsightCM SDK
-   Visual Studio 2017

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Follow the instructions on the [InsightCM getting started](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/374498G-01/) guide to configure your server and connect the monitoring devices to it.
-   Install the [InsightCM SDK package](http://www.ni.com/download/insightcm-sdk-3.3/7675/en/)

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Open a device console (command prompt or a powershell window) and change to your local SDK **azure-iot-sdk-csharp** directory.

-   Add the Iot Hub device connection string on your device as an environment variable:

        setx IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONN_STRING <yourDeviceConnectionString>

-   Run the following command to build the SDK:

        build.cmd -config Release
        
-   From the device console, run the sample using following command:

    **If HTTP protocol:**

        cd iothub\device\samples\DeviceClientHttpSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0
        dotnet DeviceClientHttpSample.dll

    **If MQTT protocol:**

        cd iothub\device\samples\DeviceClientMqttSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0
        dotnet DeviceClientMqttSample.dll
		
    **If AMQP protocol:**

        cd iothub\device\samples\DeviceClientAmqpSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0
        dotnet DeviceClientAmqpSample.dll

-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.

#Step 3.1: Send live data to Azure

-   Open an [InsightCM dashboard](http://localhost:82) on a web browser
-   Open the InsightCM Azure Example with Visual Studio 2017
-   On the Example Service project:
    -   Update the Connection String, Device Name and Protocol Type with the corresponding information.
-   Run the ExampleService App.
-   Force Trigger your monitoring device
-   The console should show you a message for each time you force trigger your monitoring device.
