# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect NEC FC-S22U device running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   NEC FC-S22U device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-  You will need to have the NEC FC-S22U configured with Setting to be on Developer Mode. Please refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) for details.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2017 (or 2015).
-   Open the **iothub_csharp_deviceclient.sln** solution in the `device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **UWPSAmple (Universal Windows)** project, open the ***ConnectionStringProvider.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        public static string Value => "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **UWPSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. With the UWPSample app UI, you should be able to send and receive message to and from the Azure IoT Hub. For instance, to send a message with MQTT protocol, select **MQTT** from the pulldown menu and specify the message in string, then click **Send message:** button on the UWPSample app. To receive, use the **DeviceExplorer** to send the message, and just click **Receive message** button on the UWPSample app.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
