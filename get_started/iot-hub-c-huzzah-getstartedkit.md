# Get Started with Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit - Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 (Arduino-compatible)

This page contains technical information to help you get familiar with Azure IoT using the Azure IoT Starter Kit - Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 (Arduino-compatible). You will find two tutorials that will walk you through different scenarios: the first tutorial will show you how to connect your Azure IoT Starter kit to our Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution from Azure IoT Suite. In the second tutorial, you will leverage Azure IoT services to create your own IoT architecture.

You can choose to start with whichever tutorial you want to. If you've never worked with Azure IoT services before, we encourage you to start with the Remote Monitoring solution tutorial, because all of the Azure services will be provisioned for you in a built-in preconfigured solution. Then you can explore how each of the services work by going through the second tutorial.

 We hope you enjoy the process. Please provide feedback if there's anything that we can improve.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/pending_status.png" width="500"/>
</p>

<a name="section1.5" />
## 1.5 Configure the Arduino IDE

In this step, we will be using the Arduino IDE. If you have not downloaded the IDE, please download it from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

<a name="section1.5.1" />
### 1.5.1 Add the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 to the Arduino IDE

You will need to install the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 board extension for the Arduino IDE. In our steps below, we will be following the same instructions as in [this link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide), which you can also use for troubleshooting. After going through the following steps, you should have a working sample with a blinking light on your board.

Open the Arduino IDE and go to `File -> Preferences`

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/arduino_preferences.jpg" width="500"/>
</p>

Go to the field titled `"Additional Boards Manager URLs:"` and type  `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/board_manager_url.jpg" width="500"/>
</p>

Click on `Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager`

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/boards_manager.JPG" width="500"/>
</p>

Search for `esp8266`, left click on the result titled `esp8266 by ESP8266 Community` and click on install

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/esp8266_board.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

After the board is installed select `Tools -> Board -> Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266`

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/select_esp8266_board.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

<a name="section1.5.2" />
### 1.5.2 Configuration settings

Set the CPU frequency to 80MHz by clicking on `Tools -> CPU Frequency -> 80MHz`

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/frequency_80mhz.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

Set the upload speed to 115200 by clicking on `Tools -> Upload Speed -> 115200`

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/upload_speed_115200.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

Set the COM port by clicking on `Tools -> Port -> COMx`. If you see multiple COM ports, then you will have to experiment, in order to find the one that corresponds to your device. One way to do that is to disconnect your device, check the list of COM ports, reconnect the device and then find which port was not there before.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/select_com_port.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

In order to verify that you've set the correct COM port, you can click on `Tools -> Get Board Info`. If you see the message "Native serial port, can't obtain port info", then you have not selected the correct port. You can change the COM port using the step above and retry this step, until you see a message similar to:

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/get_board_info.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

If you run into any connection issues, unplug the board, hold the reset button, and while still holding it, plug the board back in. This will flash to board to try again.

<a name="section1.5.3" />
### 1.5.3 Install Library Dependencies

For this project, we'll also need the following libraries:

 - Adafruit DHT Unified 
 - DHT Sensor Library
 - AzureIoTHub
 - AzureIoTUtility
 - AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT
 - Adafruit Unified Sensor
 
To install these libraries, click on the `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/manage_libraries.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

Search for each of these libraries using the box in the upper-right to filter your search, click on the found library, and click the "Install" button.

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/search_for_libraries.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

If you have any problems while installing the libraries, you can find more instructions [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

***
**Note**: Starting on version 1.0.17, `AzureIoTHub` required the `AzureIoTUtility` and one of the available protocols. These samples use the `AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT`, but it is prepared to work with `AzureIoTProtocol_HTTP` too.
***

<a name="section1.6" />
## 1.6 Modify the Remote Monitoring sample

- Unzip the [example code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-huzzah-getstartedkit/archive/master.zip), go to the `remote_monitoring` directory and double-click the file `remote_monitoring.ino` to open the project in the Arduino IDE.
- In the project, edit the `iot_configs.h`, look for the following lines of code:

```
#define IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_SSID            "<Your WiFi network SSID or name>"
#define IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_PASSWORD        "<Your WiFi network WPA password or WEP key>"
```

- Replace the placeholders with your WiFi name (SSID) and the WiFi password. 
- Find the Device id, Iot Hub Hostname and Device Key that you wrote down, when you saw the following screen after adding your custom device into the Azure IoT suite:

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/copy_credentials.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

If you cannot find this data, then you can go to your Remote Monitoring Solution in Azure IoT Suite, click on Devices and then select your device. Check the device properties section at the right part of the page for the DEVICEID, HOSTNAME and Authentication Keys (bottom right of the page). Click on "View Authentication keys" and copy "KEY 1" as your deviceKey.

- Look for the following line of code and replace the placeholders connection information (also remove the "<" and ">" when replacing the information):

```
#define IOT_CONFIG_CONNECTION_STRING    "HostName=<host_name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=<device_id>;SharedAccessKey=<device_key>"
```

- Save with `Control-s`

<a name="section1.7" />
## 1.7 Build and Run Your Remote Monitoring Sample

- Build, upload and run the code using **Sketch -> Upload** or by clicking on the arrow button (second from the left)

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/upload_button.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

- If your code is correct and all libraries was properly installed, you will receive something like the following message in the IDE.

  ```
  Sketch uses 376,409 bytes (36%) of program storage space. Maximum is 1,044,464 bytes.
  Global variables use 50,220 bytes (61%) of dynamic memory, leaving 31,700 bytes for
    local variables. Maximum is 81,920 bytes.
  ```

- While the code is being downloaded, there should be a blue blinking LED on your Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266.
- After the deployment is done and you see 100% in the output console, then go to **Tools -&gt; Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE to watch the live data being sent. After 15 seconds you should see a measurements update.

***
**Note**: When first starting you will likely see a “Fetching NTP epoch time failed” error – This is normal, and it trying to sync with Azure. This can take even up to 30 seconds to find a NTP server to sync with. One it is synced, it should start transmitting from there.
***

<a name="section1.8" />
## 1.8 View the Sensor Data from the Remote Monitoring Portal

- Once you have the sample running, visit your dashboard by visiting azureiotsuite.com and clicking “Launch” on your solution
- Make sure the “Device to View” in the upper right is set to your device
- If the demo is running, you should see the graph change as your data updates in real time!

<a name="section1.9" />
## 1.9 Stop using the Azure IoT Suite

***
**Warning:** The Remote Monitoring solution provisions a set of Azure IoT Services in your Azure account. It is meant to reflect a real enterprise architecture and thus its Azure consumption is quite heavy. 

To avoid unnecessary Azure consumption, you can delete, stop or downsize your Azure IoT Suite. We recommend you delete the preconfigured solution in azureiotsuite.com once you are done with your work (since it is easy to recreate). 

If you want to read additional information about the Azure IoT Suite, you can go the following websites:
 - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-sample-walkthrough/
 - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-suite-connecting-devices/

<a name="section1.9.1" />
### 1.9.1 Delete the Azure IoT Suite

Go to https://www.azureiotsuite.com, click on your existing solution (not on the "Launch" button) and then click the red button `Delete Solution` in the right pane

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/delete_suite.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

<a name="section1.9.2" />
### 1.9.2 Stop the Azure IoT Suite

In the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
- Click on "All Resources"
- For each Stream Analytics and Web App resource:
    - Click on the resource and click the "Stop" button in the new blade that appears
- For each IoT Hub resource:
    - Click on the resource and click the "Devices" button in the new blade that appears
    - Click on each device in the list and click the "Disable" button that appears in the new blade at the bottom

<a name="section1.9.3" />
### 1.9.3 Downsize the Azure IoT Suite

Alternatively, if you want to keep it up and running you can do two things to reduce consumption:

1) Visit this [guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-remote-monitoring/blob/master/Docs/configure-preconfigured-demo.md) to run the solution in demo mode and reduce the Azure consumption.  

2) Disable the simulated devices created with the solution (Go to Devices>>Select the device>> on the device details menu on the right, clich on Disable Device. Repeat with all the simulated devices).

## 2.1 Tutorial Overview

This tutorial has the following steps:
- Provision an IoT Hub instance on Microsoft Azure and adding your device.
- Prepare the device, get connected to the device, and set it up so that it can read sensor data.
- Configure your Microsoft Azure IoT services by adding Event Hub, Storage Account, and Stream Analytics resources.
- Prepare your local web solution for monitoring and sending commands to your device.
- Update the sample code to respond to commands and include the data from our sensors, sending it to Microsoft Azure to be viewed remotely.

Here is a breakdown of the data flow:
- The application running on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 will get temperature data from the temperature sensor and it will send them to the IoT Hub
- A Stream Analytics job will read the data from IoT Hub and write them to an Azure Storage Table. Also, if an anomaly is detected, then this job will write data to an Event Hub
- The Node.js application that is running on your computers will read the data from the Azure Storage Table and the Event Hub and will present them to the user

The end result will be a functional command center where you can view the history of your device's sensor data, a history of alerts, and send commands back to the device.

## 2.7 Create a Stream Analytics job to Save IoT Data in Table Storage and Raise Alerts
Stream Analytics is an Azure IoT service that streams and analyzes data in the cloud. We'll use it to process data coming from your device.

- Log on to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
- In the menu, click **New**, then click **Internet of Things**, and then click **Stream Analytics Job**
- Enter a name for the job (We chose “HuzzahStorageJob”), a preferred region, then choose your subscription. At this stage you are also offered to create a new or to use an existing resource group. Choose the resource group you created earlier.
- Once the job is created, open your **Job’s blade** or click on the **pinned tile**, and find the section titled _“Job Topology”_ and click the **Inputs** tile. In the Inputs blade, click on **Add**
- Enter the following settings:
    - Input Alias = _`TempSensors`_
    - Source Type = _`Data Stream`_
    - Source = _`IoT Hub`_
    - IoT Hub = _`Huzzah2Suite`_ (use the name for the IoT Hub you create before)
    - Shared Access Policy Name = _`iothubowner`_
    - Shared Access Policy Key = _The `iothubowner` primary key can be found in your IoT Hub Settings -> Shared access policies_
    - IoT Hub Consumer Group = "" (leave it to the default empty value)
    - Event serialization format = _`JSON`_
    - Encoding = _`UTF-8`_

- Back to the **Stream Analytics Job blade**, click on the **Query tile** (next to the Inputs tile). In the Query settings blade, type in the below query and click **Save**:

```
SELECT
    DeviceId,
    EventTime,
    MTemperature as TemperatureReading
INTO
    TemperatureTableStorage
from TempSensors
WHERE
   DeviceId is not null
   and EventTime is not null

SELECT
    DeviceId,
    EventTime,
    MTemperature as TemperatureReading
INTO   
    TemperatureAlertToEventHub
FROM
    TempSensors
WHERE MTemperature>25
```

***
**Note:** You can change the `25` to `0` when you're ready to generate alerts to look at. This number represents the temperature in degrees celsius to check for when creating alerts. 25 degrees celsius is 77 degrees fahrenheit.
***

- Back to the **Stream Analytics Job blade**, click on the **Outputs** tile and in the **Outputs blade**, click on **Add**
- Enter the following settings then click on **Create**:
    - Output Alias = _`TemperatureTableStorage`_
    - Sink = _`Table Storage`_
    - Subscription = _`Provide table settings storage manually`_
    - Storage account = _`huzzahstorage`_ (The storage account you created earlier)
    - Storage account key = _(The primary key for the storage account made earlier, can be found in Settings -&gt; Keys -&gt; Primary Access Key)_
    - Table Name = _`TemperatureRecords`_ (Your choice - If the table doesn’t already exist, Local Storage will create it)
    - Partition Key = _`DeviceId`_
    - Row Key = _`EventTime`_
    - Batch size = _`1`_
- Back to the **Stream Analytics Job blade**, click on the **Outputs tile**, and in the **Outputs blade**, click on **Add**
- Enter the following settings then click on **Create**:
    - Output Alias = _`TemperatureAlertToEventHub`_
    - Sink = _`Event Hub`_
    - Subscription = _`Provide table settings storage manually`_
    - Service Bus Namespace = _`Huzzah2Suite`_
    - Event Hub Name = _`huzzaheventhub`_ (The Event Hub you made earlier)
    - Event Hub Policy Name = _`readwrite`_
    - Event Hub Policy Key = _`Primary Key for readwrite Policy name`_ (That's the one you wrote down after creating the event hub)
    - Partition Key Column = _`0`_
    - Event Serialization format = _`JSON`_
    - Encoding = _`UTF-8`_
    - Format = _`Line separated`_
- Back in the** Stream Analytics blade**, start the job by clicking on the **Start **button at the top

***
**Note:** Make sure to **stop** your Command Center jobs once you have when you take a break or finish to avoid unnecessary Azure consumption!  (See: [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting))

        - If you used the instructions above, you would have named it ***`TemperatureRecords`***
        - If you named it something else, enter the name you used instead.    

```
{
    "port": "3000",
    "eventHubName": "event-hub-name",
    "ehConnString": "Endpoint=sb://name.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=readwrite;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=",
    "deviceConnString": "HostName=name.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=device-id;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=="
    "iotHubConnString": "HostName=iot-hub-name.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=service;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=",
    "storageAcountName": "aaaaaaaaaaa",
    "storageAccountKey": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa==",
    "storageTable": "TemperatureRecords"
}
```

- Now it is time to run it! Enter the following command:

```
node server.js
```

- You should then see something similar to:

```
app running on http://localhost:3000
client connected
```

- Visit the url in your browser and you will see the Node app running!

To deploy this project to the cloud using Azure, you can reference [Creating a Node.js web app in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/).

Next, we will update your device so that it can interact with all the things you just created.

<a name="section2.9" />
## 2.9 Add the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 to the Arduino IDE

You will need to install the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 board extension for the Arduino IDE:

- Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide). There you will see how to add a URL pointing to Adafruit's repository of board extensions, how to make the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 board selectable under the **Tools** menu, and how to get the Blink sketch to run.
  - As we explained on the item 1.5, boards with microB connector don't have the GPIO0 button. So, in the 'Blink Test', ignore the steps to put the board in the bootload mode, and go directly to the step to upload the sketch via the IDE.
- After going through this, you should have a working sample with a blinking light on your board.
    - If you run into any connection issues, unplug the board, hold the reset button, and while still holding it, plug the board back in. This will flash to board to try again.

<a name="section2.10" />
## 2.10 Install Library Dependencies

For this project, we'll also need the the following libraries:

 - DHT Sensor Library
 - Adafruit DHT Unified
 - AzureIoTHub
 - AzureIoTUtility
 - AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT

To install them, click on the `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`. Search for each library using the box in the upper-right to filter your search, click on the found library, and click the "Install" button.

The Adafruit Unified Sensor library is also needed. This can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor). Instructions for manually installing a library can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

<a name="section2.11" />
## 2.11 Modify the Command Center sample

- Unzip the example code, and double-click the file `command_center.ino` to open the project in the Arduino IDE.
- You will be prompted to creat a folder. Do this, and move the other files in the folder into the newly created child folder
- Look for the following lines of code:

```
static const char ssid[] = "[Your WiFi network SSID or name]";
static const char pass[] = "[Your WiFi network WPA password or WEP key]";
static const char* connectionString = "[Device Connection String]";
```

- Replace the placeholders with your WiFi name (SSID), WiFi password, and the device connection string you created at the beginning of this tutorial. 
- Save with `Control-s`

- In the same project, click on the `command_center.c` tab to see that file.
- Look for the following lines of code:

```
static const char DeviceId[] = "[Device Name]";
static const char connectionString[] = "[Device Connection String]";
```

- Replace the placeholders with your Device ID and connection string you created at the beginning of this tutorial. 
- Save with `Control-s`

<a name="section2.12" />
## 2.12 Build Your Command Center Sample

- Build and upload the code using **Sketch -&gt;  Upload**.

***
**Note**: As of 1.6.8, the Arduino IDE doesn't properly show "Upload Completed", even when it succeeds.
***
- There should now be a blue blinking LED on your Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266. After the deployment is done and you see 100% in the output console, then go to **Tools -&gt; Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE to watch the live data being sent. After 15 seconds you should see a measurements update.
- Data is now being sent off at regular intervals to Microsoft Azure. When it detects something out of range, you will see the LED you’ve set up turn from green to red!
- You can click the green button (labeled "Turn on") and the red button (labeled "Turn off") in the application to toggle the green and red LEDs in your kit.

Head back to your Node application and you will have a fully functional command center, complete with a history of sensor data, alerts that display when the temperature got outside a certain range, and commands that you can send to your device remotely.

***
**Note:** Make sure to **stop** your Command Center jobs once you have when you finish to avoid unnecessary Azure consumption!  (See: [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting))
