# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect {enter your device name here} device running {enter the OS name running on device} with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   {enter your device name here} device.
-   {{Please specify if any other software(s) or hardware(s) are required.}}

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   {{Write down the instructions required to setup, configure and connect your device. Please use external links when possible pointing to your own page with device preparation steps.}}

<a name="Build"></a>
# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Open a device console (command prompt or a powershell window) and change to your local SDK **azure-iot-sdk-csharp** directory.

-  Add the Iot Hub device connection string on your device as an environment variable:

		setx IOTHUB_DEVICE_CONN_STRING <yourDeviceConnectionString>

-  Run the following command to build the SDK:

		build.cmd -config Release
        
- From the device console, run the sample using following command:

	**If HTTP protocol:**

		cd iothub\device\samples\DeviceClientHttpSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0
		dotnet DeviceClientHttpSample.dll

	**If MQTT protocol:**

		cd iothub\device\samples\DeviceClientMqttSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0
		dotnet DeviceClientMqttSample.dll
		
	**If AMQP protocol:**

		cd iothub\device\samples\DeviceClientAmqpSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0
		dotnet DeviceClientAmqpSample.dll

-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
