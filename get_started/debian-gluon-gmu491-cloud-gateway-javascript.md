# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Gluon GMU491 Cloud Gateway device running Debian Linux with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Computer with Git client installed 
-   Gluon GMU491 Cloud Gateway device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-	Connect the Gluon GMU491 Cloud Gateway to your network using an ethernet cable. Gluon GMU491 Cloud Gateway will get an IP address from your DHCP server. You can also directly connect the Gluon GMU491 Cloud Gateway to your PC, it will then act as a DHCP server and can be found in IP 192.168.1.100.
-	Power on the Gluon GMU491 Cloud Gateway and wait about a minute for it to boot up.
-	Open an SSH terminal program, such as PuTTY, on your desktop machine and connect to your device using the IP address from the previous step (Port 22, user root, pass comprog)

# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in
    PuTTY:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node.git

-   Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory ~/azure-iot-sdk-node.

<a name="BuildSamples"></a>
## 3.2 Build the samples

-   To validate the source code run the following commands on the device.

        export IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING='<iothub_connection_string>'

    Replace the `<iothub_connection_string>` placeholder with IoTHub Connection String you got in [Step 1](#Prerequisites).    

-   Run the following commands 

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/
		rm /home/ionsign/gmu.log.* -rf
		rm /home/ionsign/pins/*log -rf
		rm c docs .git csharp java -rf
		cd node
		apt-get update
		apt-get install libssl-dev uuid -y
		apt-get clean
		npm install uuid
        build/dev-setup.sh
        build/build.sh | tee LogFile.txt

    ***Note:*** *LogFile.txt in above command should be replaced with a file name where build output will be written.*

-   Install npm package to run sample.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/node/device/samples

    **For AMQP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-amqp
	
    **For HTTP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-http
	
    **For MQTT Protocol:**

        npm install azure-iot-device-mqtt	

-   To update sample, run the following command on device.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/node/device/samples
        nano simple_sample_device.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    protocol information.
    
-   Find the below code:

        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').Amqp;
	
    The default protocol used is AMQP. Code for other protocols(HTTP/MQTT) are mentioned just below the above line in the script.
    Uncomment the line as per the protocol you want to use.


-   Scroll down to the connection information.
    Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string. You can get this from DeviceExplorer as explained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites), that you copied into Notepad.

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

-   Run the following command before leaving the **~/azure-iot-sdk-node/node/device/samples** directory

        npm link azure-iot-device

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received.

        node ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/node/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
