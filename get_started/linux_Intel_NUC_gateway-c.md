# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Intel NUC gateway device running Ubuntu 16.04 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Intel® NUC Gateway device.


<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Setup Intel® NUC Gateway referring to the official documentation [page][lnk-gateway-setup]
-   Create USB for the Ubuntu 16.04 OS image obtained from Ubuntu [webpage][link-ubuntu-os] 
-   Plug in the USB in Intel® NUC and then power on it. 
-   During boot, press F10 to select boot drive as UEFI:USB and start the Ubuntu setup.

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre

        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

   -   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:
   
    **For AMQP protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdk-c/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp.c

    **For HTTPS protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdk-c/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c

    **For MQTT protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdk-c/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK using following command.

        sudo ./azure-iot-sdk-c/c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

    **For AMQP protocol:**

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp

    **For using HTTP protocol:**

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http

    **For using MQTT protocol:**

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
