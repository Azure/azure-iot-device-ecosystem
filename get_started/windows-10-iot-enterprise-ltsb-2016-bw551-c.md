# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **azure_iot_sdks.sln** solution in the **cmake_Win32** folder in your user profile folder.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **Serializer_Samples** folder.
-   In the **simplesample_http** project, open the ***simplesample_http.c*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   In visual Studio, under Solution Explorer, right-click the **simplesample_http** project, click ***Debug &minus;&gt; Start new instance*** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application and how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
