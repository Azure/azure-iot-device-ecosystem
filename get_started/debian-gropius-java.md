# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [Gropius device][lnk-gropius-device]
-   SSH client on your desktop computer, such as [PuTTY][lnk-putty] or [openssh][lnk-openssh], so you can remotely access the command line on the Gropius.
-   Ethernet cable and Gropius console cable


# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Follow the instructions on the [Gropius support site][lnk-gropius-support] to setup, configure and connect Gropius to your computer

# Step 3: Build SDK and Run the sample

## 3.1 Install Azure IoT Device SDK and prerequisites on device

-   Open a SSH session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages by issuing the following commands from the command line on the device.

### 3.1.1  Install Java JDK and set up environment variables
        
1.  Install OpenJDK.

        apt-get update        
        apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk      
   
    ***Note:*** *If openjdk-8-jdk package is not available, use following steps to add source in sources.list and rerun above commands again.*
    
    -   Edit /etc/apt/sources.list
    
    -   Add below line and save the changes.
        
		`deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ wheezy-backports main contrib non-free`
		`deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sid main contrib non-free`

          
2.  Update the PATH environment variable to include the full path to the bin folder containing Java. To ensure the correct path of Java run below command:     
       
        which java
        
3.  Ensure that the directory shown by the `which java` command matches one of the directories shown in your $PATH variable. You can confirm this by running following command.

        echo $PATH

4.  If Java path is missing in PATH environment variable, run following command to set the same.    

        export PATH=[PathToJava]/bin:$PATH       

    ***NOTE:*** *Here **[PathToJava]** is output of `which java` command. For example, if `which java` output is /usr/bin/java, then export command will be* **export PATH=/usr/bin/java/bin:$PATH**

5.  Make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable includes the full path to the JDK. Use below command to get the JDK path.

        update-alternatives --config java

6.  Take note of the JDK location. `update-alternatives` output will show something similar to **/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java**. The JDK directory would then be **/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/**.

7.  Run the following command to set **JAVA_HOME** environment variable.

        export JAVA_HOME=[PathToJDK]

    ***Note***: *Here [PathToJDK] is JDK directory. For example if jdk directory is /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/, export command will be* **export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/**

### 3.1.2  Install Maven and set up environment variables

1.  Install Maven

        apt-get install maven

2.  Update the PATH environment variable to include the full path to the bin folder containing maven. To ensure the correct path of maven, run below command:     
       
        which mvn
         
3.  Ensure that the directory shown by the `which mvn` command matches one of the directories shown in your $PATH variable. You can confirm this by running following command.
 
        echo $PATH

4.  If maven path is missing in PATH environment variable, run following command to set the same.     

        export PATH=[PathToMvn]/bin:$PATH

    ***Note***: *Here [PathToMvn] is output of `which mvn`. For example if `which mvn` output is /usr/bin/mvn, export command will be* **export PATH=/usr/bin/mvn/bin:$PATH**
   
5.  You can verify that the environment variables necessary to run Maven 3 have been set correctly by running `mvn --version`.

### 3.1.3  Install GIT

1.  Install Git by executing following command:

        apt-get install git

### 3.1.4 Build the Azure IoT Device SDK for Java

1.  Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in your ssh client session:

        git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java.git

2.  Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory **azure-iot-sdk-java**.

3.  Run the following commands on device in sequence to build Azure IoT SDK.

        cd azure-iot-sdk-java/java/device
        mvn install | tee JavaSDK_Build_Logs.txt

4.  Above command will generate the compiled JAR files with all dependencies. This bundle can be found at:

        azure-iot-sdk-java/java/device/iothub-java-client/target/iothub-java-client-{version}-with-deps.jar

## 3.2 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.2.1 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for send event sample.

        cd azure-iot-sdk-java/java/device/samples/send-event/target

-   Run the sample by issuing following command.

    **If using AMQPS protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "amqps"
    
    **If using HTTPS protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "https"

    **If using MQTT protocol:**

        java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "mqtt"
          
    Replace the following in above command:
    
    -   `{version}`: Version of binaries you have build
    -   `{connection string}`: Your device connection string
    -   `{number of requests to send}`: Number of messages you want to send to IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.2.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   Navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for the receive message sample.

        cd azure-iot-sdk-java/java/device/samples/handle-messages/target
     
-   Run the sample by issuing following command.

    **If using AMQPS protocol:**
   
        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "amqps"
    
    **If using HTTPS protocol:**
   
        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "https"

    **If using MQTT protocol:**
   
        java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "mqtt"
        
    Replace the following in above command:
    
    -   `{version}`: Version of binaries you have build
    -   `{connection string}`: Your device connection string
    -   `{number of requests to send}`: Number of messages you want to send to IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
