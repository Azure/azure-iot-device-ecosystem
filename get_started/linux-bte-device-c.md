# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect BTE device running Linux 4.16.7 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   BTE device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Install Linux 4.16.7

<a name="Build"></a>
# Step 3: Build and Run the sample
## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Under development environment Ubuntu 16.04, Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:

     Send Telemetry to IoT Hub Sample.Find the following place holder for editing protocol:

        // The protocol you wish to use should be uncommented
        //#define SAMPLE_HTTP
        //#define SAMPLE_MQTT
        //#define SAMPLE_MQTT_OVER_WEBSOCKETS
        //#define SAMPLE_AMQP
        //#define SAMPLE_AMQP_OVER_WEBSOCKETS

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string 

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";


-   Build the SDK using following command. Set  tool chain cross compiler

        export CC=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc
        sudo ./azure-iot-sdk-c/build_all/linux/build.sh | tee c_log_file.txt

**Note:** `c_log_file.txt` in above command should be replaced with a file name where build output will be written.

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

        azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample/iothub_ll_telemetry_sample


-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md) to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub
-   Run the sample by issuing following command.

        azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_ll_c2d_sample/iothub_ll_c2d_sample

-   See [Manage IoT Hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/manage_iot_hub.md) to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
