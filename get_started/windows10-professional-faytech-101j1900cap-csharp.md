# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [faytech-101J1900CAP device](https://www.faytech.com/catalogue/product/101-capacitive-touch-pc-ft101j1900w4g64gcap/)

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Intsall the Windows 10 Pro on your device
-	Install properly all the hardware drivers
-	Download and install the [DeviceExplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) 
-   Download the [sample dll](https://download.faytech.com/iothub/)

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

### Build from the source code

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.

-   Install the Visual Studio 2015 (you can also use the Visual Studio 2017).

-   Navigate to the sample programs you downloaded already and open the  **iothub\_csharp_client.sln** project file with your Visual Studio program.

-   When the project is loaded into your Visual Studio, open the **DeviceClientHttpSample** project, edit the **Program.cs** source file :

    -   Comment the line number 17 
    -   Replace the line number 28:
	
            DeviceClient deviceClient = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(DeviceConnectionString, TransportType.Http1)
			
        by:
		
            DeviceClient deviceClient = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(args[0], TransportType.Http1)
			
    -   Save and compile/build the project
			
-   Open a device console (command prompt or a powershell window) and change to your local SDK **azure-iot-sdk-csharp** directory.

-   Run the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in order to enable executing Powershell scripts on your system.
        
-   From the device PowerShell console, run the sample using following command:

        cd iothub\device\samples\DeviceClientHttpSample\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0
        dotnet DeviceClientHttpSample.dll <the_device_connection_string_here>

### Use the built **DeviceClientHttpSample.dll** program

-   Download the archive file `IoTHub_FAY101J1900CAP.rar` from [faytech's downloading space](https://download.faytech.com/iothub/) and extract the content.
-   Open a powershell window and change to your extracted repository using the command `cd`
-   Run the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in order to enable executing Powershell scripts on your system.
-   Execute now the sample program by typing:
		
        dotnet DeviceClientHttpSample.dll <the_device_connexion_string_here>

-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
