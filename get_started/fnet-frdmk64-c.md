# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect FRDM-K64F device running FNET with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare IAR Embedded Workbench development environment][setup-iar]
-   [Download and install FNET][download-fnet]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [FRDM-K64F device][FRDM-K64F-board]
-   [Tera Term Pro serial terminal][tera-term-pro]

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   [Setup FRDM-K64F device][FRDM-K64F-board-setup]
-   Connect the evaluation board to an Ethernet network, which must be connected to Internet.
-   Use USB cable to connect your PC to the board.

# Step 3: Build SDK and Run the sample

-   Start a new instance of IAR Embedded Workbench IDE. Open the **azure-frdmk64f.ewp** project in the **fnet\fnet\_demos\build\frdmk64f\azure\iar** folder in your home directory.

-   In IAR Embedded Workbench IDE, in **Workspace**, navigate to **azure-frdmk64f** project, open the **fapp\_user\_config.h** file.

-   Add the following code:

        #define FAPP_CFG_AZURE_CMD_DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

-   In **Workspace**, click **Download and Debug** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.

-   See [FNET Azure IoT Hub Demo Quick Start][FNET-Azure-Quick-Start] for more information about the FNET Azure sample application.
