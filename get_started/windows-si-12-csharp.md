# Step 2: Prepare your Device

###Install Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB on SI-12

-   Create a bootable USB Drive. Please follow this guide on how to create a bootable drive (<https://www.microsoft.com/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool>)
-   Insert the bootable USB Drive from the previous step into your SI-12. Turn on your SI-12 device and press the **Delete** key.
-   Change the BIOS Boot option filter to **Boot**.
-   Change the **Boot Option Priorities** to boot from your USB Drive.
-   Save changes and restart your device. Follow on screen instructions to install Windows Operating System on your SI-12.
-   When Windows 10 installation is completed, remember to [change to developer mode](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devschool/2015/05/06/windows-10-setting-the-developer-mode/).

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub_csharp_client.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **DeviceClientHttpSample** project, open the ***Program.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **DeviceClientHttpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client HTTP Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
