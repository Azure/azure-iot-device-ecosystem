# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Pine64 device running Windows 10 IoT Core with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   Computer with Git client installed and access to the [azure-iot-sdk-csharp](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) GitHub public repository.
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Pine64 device.

#### Install Visual Studio 2015 and Tools

-   To create Windows IoT Core solutions, you will need to install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/vs-2015-product-editions.aspx). You can install any edition of Visual Studio, including the free Community edition.

    Make sure to select the **Universal Windows App Development Tools**, the component required for writing apps Windows 10.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Click [here](http://files.pine64.org/os/win10-iot/Pine64_Win10IoTCore10586_beta0.1.ffu) to download the FFU.
-   Download and install the [IoT Dashboard](https://iottools.blob.core.windows.net/iotdashboardpreview/setup.exe)
-   Prepare a microSD(TF) card 8GB at least and a card reader.
-   Connect your microSD card to your PC, and start the IoT Dashboard application.
-   Select **Setup new device** tab, then you can see some options to setup a device.
-   Select **Customize** for "Device type", then click **Browser** button to open the FFU downloaded above.
-   Plug in your microSD card and keep other options as default.
-   Check the **Agreen licence** option and click **Install** button.
-   Plug the microSD card in and power on.

# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Step_3_1:_Connect"></a>
## 3.1 Connect the Device

-   Prepare a USB hub, USB wifi adapter, HDMI monitor and an HDMI cable.

-   Connect the USB hub, USB wifi adapter and monitor with the board and power on.

-   After startup, connect the same WLAN with your develop PC in the setting page.

## 3.2  Build the Samples

-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015. Open the **iothub_csharp_client.sln** solution (/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/csharp) from your local copy of the repository.

-   In Visual Studio, from **Solution Explorer**, navigate to the **UWPSample(Universal Windows)** project.

-   Locate the following code in the **ConnectionStrings.cs** file:

        public const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Step-1:-Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Choose the right architecture (ARM) and set the debugging method to "Remote Machine".

-   To deploy the binaries on your device, right-click on the UWPSample project in the **Solution Explorer**, select **Properties** and navigate to the **Debug** tab.

    Type in the IP address of your device. Make sure the "Use authentication" box is unchecked.

-   Build the solution.

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IoT Hub

-   In Visual Studio, from **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **UWPSample(Universal Windows)** project, click **Debug &minus;&gt; Start new instance** to build and run the sample. 

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
