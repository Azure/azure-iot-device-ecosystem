# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Cubieboard2 device running Lubuntu with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

	- You should have cubieboard2 (http://cubieboard.org/model/cb2/)
	- Latest version of Lubutu server version (http://dl.cubieboard.org/software/a20-cubieboard/lubuntu/)
	- Livesuit (http://cubieboard.org/download/)

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

	Preparing the Cubieboard2 board

    - Ensure that the Lubuntu image is installed.   Please follow the instructions on cubieboard's official documentation portal :-http://dl.cubieboard.org/software/a20-cubieboard/lubuntu/
	- Tools required to install the OS can be found here:- http://cubieboard.org/download/
	- After installing the image, use putty to login into the device. 
	- Please refer to the User name and password as described in above page.

# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Run following command to check if NodeJS is already installed

	**For AMQP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-amqp
	
    **For HTTP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-http
	
    **For MQTT Protocol:**

        npm install azure-iot-device-mqtt	

-   To update sample, run the following command on device.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/node/device/samples
        vi simple_sample_device.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    protocol information.
    
-   Find the below code:

        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').Amqp;
	
    The default protocol used is AMQP. Code for other protocols(HTTP/MQTT) are mentioned just below the above line in the script.
    Uncomment the line as per the protocol you want to use.


-   Scroll down to the connection information.
    Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string. You can get this from DeviceExplorer as explained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites), that you copied into Notepad.

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

-   Run the following command before leaving the **~/azure-iot-sdk-node/node/device/samples** directory

        npm link azure-iot-device

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received.

        node ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/node/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
