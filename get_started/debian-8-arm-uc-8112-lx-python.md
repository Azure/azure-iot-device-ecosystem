# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-python]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   UC-8112-LX device.

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for Python by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev build-essential cmake git python2.7-dev libboost-python-dev


-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK to the board by issuing the following command on the board:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python.git

-   Run following commands to build the SDK:

        cd python/build_all/linux
	    sudo ./build.sh    

-   After a successful build, the `iothub_client.so` Python extension module is copied to the **python/device/samples** folder.

- Navigate to samples folder by executing following command:

        cd azure-iot-sdk-python/python/device/samples/

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:

    **For HTTP protocol:**

        nano iothub_client_sample_http.py

    **For MQTT protocol:**

        nano iothub_client_sample_mqtt.py

-   Find the following place holder for device connection string:

        connectionString = "[device connection string]"

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample application using the following command:

    **For HTTP protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample_http.py

    **For MQTT protocol:**

        python iothub_client_sample_mqtt.py

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
