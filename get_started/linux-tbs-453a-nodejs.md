# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect TBS-453A device running docker-library/node:6.11 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   QNAP TBS-453A device.
-   Connect TBS-453A and your computer to internet

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Install the latest Container Station on your TBS-453A by following the instructions in the ["How to use Container Station?"](https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/tutorial/article/how-to-use-container-station).

-   Create "node:6.11" container in Container Station and start it.

-   Into Terminal two options :
    -   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device use SSH. Then key in command : 
        
            docker exec -ti <your container name> bash

    -   Or click "Terminal" button on container station website and key in "bash" then click ok to enter terminal

-   Install Text editor "nano" : 

        apt update
        apt install nano

# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open NAS webpage and open Container Station.

-   Change page to your container.

-   Click "Terminal" button and key in "bash" in your node.js container to enter terminal.

-   Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in
    terminal:

        cd ~
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node.git

-   Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory ~/azure-iot-sdk-node.

<a name="BuildSamples"></a>
## 3.2 Build the samples

-   To validate the source code run the following commands on the device.

        export IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING='<iothub_connection_string>'

    Replace the `<iothub_connection_string>` placeholder with IoTHub Connection String you got in [Step 1](#Prerequisites).    

-   Run the following commands 

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node
        build/dev-setup.sh
        build/build.sh | tee LogFile.txt

    ***Note:*** *LogFile.txt in above command should be replaced with a file name where build output will be written.*

-   Install npm package to run sample.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples

    **For AMQP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-amqp
	
    **For HTTP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-http
	
    **For MQTT Protocol:**

        npm install azure-iot-device-mqtt	

-   To update sample, run the following command on device.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples
        nano simple_sample_device.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    protocol information.
    
-   Find the below code:

        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').Amqp;
	
    The default protocol used is MQTT. Code for other protocols(HTTP/AMQP) are mentioned just below the above line in the script.
    Uncomment the line as per the protocol you want to use.


-   Scroll down to the connection information.
    Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string. You can get this from DeviceExplorer as explained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites), that you copied into Notepad.

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

-   Run the following command before leaving the **~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples** directory

        npm link azure-iot-device

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received.

        node ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
