# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect echocollect model e or r-m device with Azure IoT. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Configure the device to publish PLC data to Azure IoT

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Create a SAS token for your device as described in [iot-hub-mqtt-support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-Us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-mqtt-support)
-   echocollect (e or r-m) device configured to connect to PLCs.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   With the configuration program NetCon create a new MQTT connection.

![firstWizardpage](media/echocollect-mqtt1.png)
-   On the first wizard page you need to enter the IoT-hub device-id of your device as client id. In the screenshot above the device-id is "echocollect".

![secondWizardpage](media/echocollect-mqtt2.png)
-   On the second wizard page you need to enter the URI of your Azure IoT hub for MQTT connections. In the screenshot above: ´IoT-Hub-paid-S1.azure-devices.net:8883´.
-   As user name you need to enter the name of your Azure IoT hub, ´.azure-devices.net/´ and the device-id. In the screenshot above: ´IoT-Hub-paid-S1.azure-devices.net/echocollect´.
-   Finally you need to enter the SAS token, which you have created with the deviceExplorer for your device.
    You need to enter/copy the part after the ´SharedAccessSignature=´ part as password!

![thirdWizardpage](media/echocollect-mqtt3.png)
-   On the 3rd wizard page you need to set the MQTT Root Topic: ´devices/<device-id>/messages/events´. In the screenshot above: ´devices/echocollect/messages/events´.
-   Select flattened PLC hierarchy.
-   Set the MQTT payload format string:

```
{"HostName":"Softing","MonitoredItem":{"Id":"s=@ITEM@","Uri":"http://industrial.softing.com/echocollect"},"Value":{"Value":"@VALUE@","SourceTimestamp":"@TIME@","ServerTimestamp":"@TIME@","quality":"@QUALITY@"}}
```

-   Select QoS0 or QoS1
-   Set the minimum sampling intervall as needed by your application. *ATTENTION:* The PLC data would be sampled with this rate, which could cause a huge ammount of messages to the Azure IoT hub!

-   Finally choose the PLC symbols you want to send to your Azure IoT hub.
