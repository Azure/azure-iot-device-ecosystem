# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect an INSYS Smart Device device running Debian Linux with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   INSYS Smart Device with Internet access, commissioned using the Startup Wizard as described in the Quick Installation Guide
-   Debian 9 (Stretch) container available in the INSYS Knowledge Base

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-  Open web interface of the router using a browser (default IP: 192.168.1.1, default user name: insys, default password: icom). 
- In the Administration -> Container menu, click on Browse in the Import container section. Select the container file and click on Import container.
- Generate a configuration for the imported container by clicking on the magic wand symbol.
- Configure the imported container by clicking on the pen symbol.
- Under Bridge to IP net, select the network of the INSYS Smart Device to which your application is connected.
- Specify an IP address for the container in this network.
- Under User group for CLI without authentication, select Read/Write.
- Click on Save Settings.
- Activate the profile by clicking the blinking gear in the title bar.

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device under above specified container IP address.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:


        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
   

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK using following command.

        sudo ./azure-iot-sdk-c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:
        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.

- If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

  ```
  cd ./c/serializer/build/linux
  make -f makefile.linux all
  ```
