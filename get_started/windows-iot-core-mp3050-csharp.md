# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect MP3050 device running Windows IoT Core with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-windows]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   MP3050 device.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub\_csharp\_deviceclient.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **UWPSample (Universal Windows)** project, open the ***IoTClient.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        public const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   Choose the right architecture “x64” and set the debugging method to "Remote Machine":

    To deploy the binaries on your device, right-click on the **UWPSample** project in the **Solution Explorer**, select **Properties** and navigate to the **Debug** tab:

    Type your *device name* or *ip address*. 

    Make sure the Authentication Mode is **Universal (Unencrypted Protocol)**

-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client AMQP Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
