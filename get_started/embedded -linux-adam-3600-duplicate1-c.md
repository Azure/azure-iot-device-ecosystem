# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect ADAM-3600 device running embedded linux with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   ADAM-3600 device.
-   VM Ubuntu14.04
-   Cross compiler tools

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Connect the ADAM-3600 device to the network,then open the TagLink Stutio software to search the device's ip address.

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.
-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to your LINUX development VM by issuing the following command:
		git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git

-   Set up the cross compiler setting.
-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.


-   Build the SDK using following command

        ./azure-iot-sdk-c/build_all/linux/build.sh --skip-unittests --no-amqp --no-mqtt --toolchain-file <the cross compiler>

-	Copy the *iothub_client_sample_mqtt file* to ADAM-3600 device.



## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Using the session on Putty and Run the sample by issuing following command:
	```
	./iothub_client_sample_mqtt
	```
-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
