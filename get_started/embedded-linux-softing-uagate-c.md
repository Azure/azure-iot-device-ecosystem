# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect dataFEED uaGate SI and dataFEED edgeGate device with Azure IoT. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Configure the device to publish PLC data to Azure IoT

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Create a SAS token for your device as described in [iot-hub-mqtt-support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-Us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-mqtt-support)
-   dataFEED uaGate SI or dataFEED edgeGate configured to connect to PLC.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Connect with a browser to the configuration web pages of the device.
-   Login as `administrator` or `itadmin`.
-   Navigate to the `MQTT Broker configuration` page, as in the screen shot below.

On the MQTT Broker Configuration page you need to enter the following:
-   The URI of your Azure IoT hub for MQTT connections.
    In the screenshot above: `IoT-Hub-paid-S1.azure-devices.net`.
-   The port number for secure MQTT connections: 8883.
-   The IoT-hub device-id of your device as client id.
    In the screenshot above the device-id is "uagate".
-   As user name you need to enter the name of your Azure IoT hub, `.azure-devices.net/` and the device-id.
    In the screenshot above: `IoT-Hub-paid-S1.azure-devices.net/uagate`.
-   You need to enter the SAS token, which you have created with the deviceExplorer for your device.
    You need to enter/copy the part after the ´SharedAccessSignature=´ part as password!
-   Use the save button to write your configuration changes into the device.

-   Navigate to the `MQTT Topic Settings` page, as in the screen shot below.
![firstMqttpage](media/uagate-mqtt2.png)

On the `MQTT Topic Settings` page you need to enter the following:
-   Set the MQTT Root Topic: `devices/<device-id>/messages/events`.
In the screenshot above: `devices/uagate/messages/events`.
-   Select flattened PLC hierarchy.
-   Set the MQTT payload format string:

```
{
  "HostName":"Softing",
  "MonitoredItem" : {
    "Id":"s=@ITEM@",
    "Uri":"http://industrial.softing.com/uagate"
    },
  "Value": {
    "Value":"@VALUE@",
    "SourceTimestamp":"@TIME@",
    "ServerTimestamp":"@TIME@",
    "quality":"@QUALITY@"
    }
}
```

-   Select QoS0 or QoS1
-   Set the minimum sampling intervall as needed by your application.
    *ATTENTION:* The PLC data would be sampled with this rate,
    which could cause a huge ammount of messages to the Azure IoT hub!
-   Use the save button to write your configuration changes into the device.

-   Navigate to the `MQTT Topic Selection` page.
-   Choose the PLC symbols you want to send to your Azure IoT hub.
-   Use the save button to write your configuration changes into the device.
-   Finally use the `Pending settings` button to apply the update configuration.
