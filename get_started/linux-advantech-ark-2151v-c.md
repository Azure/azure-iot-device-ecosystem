## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-	Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device
-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre
    
   

-  Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the device by issuing the following command on the board:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git


-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:
  
    **For AMQP protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp.c

    **For HTTP protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c
	
    **For MQTT protocol:**
		
        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK using following command.

        ./azure-iot-sdk-c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

    **For AMQP protocol:** Run sample iothub_client_sample_amqp

        azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp

    **For HTTP protocol:** Run sample iothub_client_sample_http

        azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http

 	  **For MQTT protocol:** Run sample iothub_client_sample_mqtt

        azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_linux/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
