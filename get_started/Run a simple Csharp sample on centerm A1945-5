•	Configuring Azure IoT Hub
•	Registering your IoT device
•	Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device
Step 1: Prerequisites
You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:
•	Prepare your development environment
•	Setup your IoT hub
•	Provision your device and get its credentials
•	Centerm A1945-5 device.
•	Switch the Internet connection to Mobile Network
Step 2: Prepare your Device
•	Connect the power adapter, USB Keyborad/Mouse with Centerm A1945-5 device.

Step 3: Build and Run the sample
•	Download the Azure IoT SDK and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
•	Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
•	Open the iothub_csharp_client.sln solution in the csharp\device folder in your local copy of the repository.
•	In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the samples folder.
•	In the DeviceClientMqttSample/DeviceClientHttpSample project, open the Program.cs file.
•	Locate the following code in the file:
