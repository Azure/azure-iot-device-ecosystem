## Q. What is IoT Plug and Play?

IoT Plug and Play is an open approach based on an open language to simplify IoT solution development. It enables seamless device-to-cloud solution integration experience, without needing to write embedded device code. IoT Plug and Play allows IoT devices to describe their capabilities in a "device capability model" and present it when connecting to cloud solutions like Azure IoT Central and third-party solutions from partners, which can then automatically understand and
interact with the device.

## Q. How do I certify a gateway and sensors bundle?

Please add details to the device information section of the certification request. One of the goals is to ensure the device is ready to use when delivered, so we encourage you to add as much information as possible to ensure the best user experience.

We are also planning to release Microsoft's guidance in detail this fall. Please contact your Microsoft representative with any questions.
