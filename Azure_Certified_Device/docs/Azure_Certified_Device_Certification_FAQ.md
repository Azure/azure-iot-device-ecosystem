## Q. What are the different certification programs offered through Azure Certified Device? 

**Azure Certified Device (Required)**

The Azure Certified Device is our baseline certification program and represents the minimum requirements to gain access to the Azure Certified Device logo and have your device published in the Azure Certified Device catalog.

**IoT Plug and Play (Optional)**

The incremental IoT Plug and Play certification program enables solution builders to integrate smart devices with their solutions without manual configuration. At the core of IoT Plug and Play is a model that a device uses to advertise its capabilities to an IoT Plug and Play-enabled application. This model is tructured as a set of elements: Telemetry, properties and commands.

1.  Devices certified as IoT Plug and Play provide confidence that:Defined device models and interfaces are compliant with the [Digital Twin Definition Language](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl)

2.  Secure provisioning and easy transfer of ID scope ownership in Device Provisioning Services

3.  Easy integration with Azure IoT-based solutions using the [Digital Twin    APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-pnp/concepts-digital-twin): Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Central

4.  Validated product truth on certified devices

**Edge Managed (Optional)**

The incremental Edge Managed certification program is an evolution of the legacy IoT Edge device program and will provide a certification for those looking to raise viability to devices capable of device management standards. Requirements for being certified as an Edge Managed device include pre-installing [Azure IoT Edge](https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge/blob/master/README.md) runtime.
Pre-installing IoT Edge runtime in your device can occur at various stages in the value chain:

-   Pre-install IoT Edge runtime at the OEM or ODM manufacturing facility.

-   Pre-install IoT Edge runtime that is supplied by OEM at the point of distribution. This is the scenario where channels such as distributors, value-added resellers etc. install OEM-supplied IoT Edge runtime.

-   If the channel takes OEM Edge device, and installs the channel specific IoT Edge runtime, the program accepts the submission as a different submission entity. In this case, the channel and OEM need to agree on specifics regarding branding, device names, etc. that are shown in the [device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/).

IoT devices like Raspberry Pi3, etc. can continue to run IoT Edge runtime. The Azure Certified for IoT program is certifying against the pre-installed Edge runtime in the device controlled by either OEMs or channels to provide the best out-of-the-box experience on IoT Edge devices.

# IoT Plug and Play Device Certification #

<a name="q.-what-is-iot-plug-and-play"></a>
## Q. What is IoT Plug and Play?

IoT Plug and Play is an open approach based on an open language to simplify IoT solution development. It enables seamless device-to-cloud solution integration experience, without needing to write embedded device code. IoT Plug and Play allows IoT devices to describe their capabilities in a "device capability model" and present it when connecting to cloud solutions like Azure IoT Central and third-party solutions from partners, which can then automatically understand and
interact with the device.
