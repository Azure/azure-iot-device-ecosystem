# Azure Certified Device - Edge Secured-core (Preview) #

## Edge Secured-Core Certification Requirements ##

This document outlines the device specific capabilities and requirements that will be met in order to complete certification and list a device in the Azure IoT Device catalog with the Edge Secured-core label.

### Program Purpose ###
Edge Secured-core is an incremental certification in the Azure Certified Device program for IoT devices running a full operating system, such as Linux or Windows 10 IoT.This program enables device partners to differentiate their devices by meeting an additional set of security criteria. Devices meeting this criteria enable these promises:
1. Hardware-based device identity 
2. Capable of enforcing system integrity 
3. Stays up to date and is remotely manageable
4. Provides data at-rest protection
5. Provides data in-transit protection
6. Built in security agent and hardening
