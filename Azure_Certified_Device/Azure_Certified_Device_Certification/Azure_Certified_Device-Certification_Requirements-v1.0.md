# Azure Certified Device Requirements 
(previously known as IoT Hub)

This document outlines the device specific capabilities that will be represented in the Azure IoT Device catalog. A capability is singular device attribute that may be software implementation or combination of software and hardware implementations. 

## Program Purpose

Microsoft is simplifying IoT and Azure Certified Device certification is baseline certification program to ensure any device types are provisioned to Azure IoT Hub securely.

Promise of Azure Certified Device certification are:

1. Device support telemetry that works with IoT Hub
2.	Device support IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to securely provisioned to Azure IoT Hub
3.	Device supports easy input of target DPS ID scope transfer without requiring user to recompile embedded code.
4.	Optionally validates other elements such as cloud to device messages, direct methods and device twin 

## Requirements
